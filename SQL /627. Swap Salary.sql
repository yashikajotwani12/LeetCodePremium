Explanation: 
(1, A) and (3, C) were changed from 'm' to 'f'.
(2, B) and (4, D) were changed from 'f' to 'm'.

Write an SQL query to swap all 'f' and 'm' values (i.e., change all 'f' values to 'm' and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temporary tables.

Note that you must write a single update statement, do not write any select statement for this problem.

-- Write your MySQL query statement below
update salary
set
    sex = case sex
        when 'm' then 'f'
        when 'f' then 'm'
    end
``````````````````````
update salary set sex = IF (sex = "m", "f", "m");
