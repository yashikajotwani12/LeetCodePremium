Hi All,

I just completed my DP adventure which I started in last June and I would like to share my findings in this post.
There are total 241 dp tagged problems in LeetCode as of Today, and 26 of them are locked so I only solved the public ones.

First of all, I participated the monthly challange April & May, so this really helped me to build a habbit of daily problem solving
Then I started to solve DP problems and kept updating my monthly problem list here.
https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/665187/everyday-dp-challenge-list
The average pace was about 1 problem per day.
I read these great articles to learn the general dynamic programming knowledge & patterns
https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/458695/Dynamic-Programming-Patterns
https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/662866/DP-for-Beginners-Problems-or-Patterns-or-Sample-Solutions
The followings are my categorization of the all 215 DP problems. (In each category, problems are sorted by LeetCode difficulty)
Table version of the list: https://chuka231.blogspot.com/2021/01/leetcode-all-dynamic-programming.html
